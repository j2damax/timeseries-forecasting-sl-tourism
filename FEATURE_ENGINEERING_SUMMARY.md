# Feature Engineering Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

This feature engineering implementation follows the constraints and guidelines from the problem statement:

### 1. Design Principles (All Satisfied)

- ✅ **Parity Layer**: Shared core features (year, month, quarter) + intervention flags
- ✅ **Minimal Features**: Small dataset (91 obs) → avoided overfitting with ~16-20 features max
- ✅ **No Leakage**: Rolling stats use only past data, interventions are deterministic
- ✅ **Known at Forecast Time**: All exogenous features are deterministically definable for future
- ✅ **Interpretable**: Every feature has clear business meaning

### 2. Feature Categories Implemented

#### Core Temporal (Parity Layer)
- `year`, `month`, `quarter` - Basic time context for all models

#### Cyclical Encoding (Neural Networks)
- `month_sin`, `month_cos` - Preserves cyclical nature of months

#### Intervention Awareness (All Models)
- `easter_attacks` - Binary flag for April 2019
- `covid_period` - Binary flag for Mar 2020 - Dec 2021  
- `economic_crisis` - Binary flag for Jan 2022 onwards
- `recovery_index` - Smooth continuous recovery measure (0-1)

#### Lag Features (ML/DL Models)
- `Arrivals_lag_1`, `Arrivals_lag_3`, `Arrivals_lag_6`, `Arrivals_lag_12`
- Captures temporal dependencies at key intervals

#### Rolling Statistics (Optional)
- `Arrivals_rolling_mean_3`, `Arrivals_rolling_mean_12`
- `Arrivals_rolling_std_3`, `Arrivals_rolling_std_12`
- Computed only on past data (no future leakage)

### 3. Output Datasets (4 Variants)

| Dataset | Rows | Cols | Purpose | NaN |
|---------|------|------|---------|-----|
| `features_full.csv` | 91 | 20 | Complete set for exploration | 48 |
| `features_prophet.csv` | 91 | 9 | Prophet-optimized | 0 |
| `features_ml.csv` | 91 | 16 | ML/DL with NaN | 22 |
| `features_ml_clean.csv` | 79 | 16 | ML/DL without NaN | 0 |

### 4. Model-Specific Recommendations

#### Prophet
- Uses: `features_prophet.csv`
- Features: Interventions as regressors, Prophet handles seasonality
- No lags needed (Prophet has autoregressive component)

#### LSTM
- Uses: `features_ml_clean.csv`
- Features: All temporal + cyclical + interventions + lags
- Requires: MinMaxScaler for normalization

#### Chronos
- Uses: Original CSV (univariate)
- Features: None (zero-shot pre-trained model)

#### N-HiTS
- Uses: `features_ml_clean.csv` or univariate
- Features: Can optionally use exogenous variables
- Requires: Specific NeuralForecast format

## ✅ Validation Results

All 8 validation tests passed:

1. ✅ Data Loading - Correct shape and columns
2. ✅ All Features Creation - 20 features created
3. ✅ Prophet Features - Correct format with ds/y columns
4. ✅ ML Features - Both NaN and clean versions work
5. ✅ No Data Leakage - Rolling stats validated
6. ✅ Intervention Features - All periods correctly flagged
7. ✅ Output Files - All 4 files with expected structure
8. ✅ Cyclical Encoding - Forms unit circle, Dec/Jan proximity

## 🔄 Reusability for Prediction Pipeline

The implementation is production-ready:

```python
from scripts.feature_engineering import create_ml_features

# For new data
df_new = pd.read_csv('new_data.csv')
df_features = create_ml_features(df_new, include_lags=True, drop_na=True)

# Use in model
predictions = trained_model.predict(df_features)
```

## 📊 Key Design Decisions

1. **Minimal Feature Set**: Only 15-20 features to avoid overfitting on 91 observations
2. **No Month Dummies**: Used cyclical encoding instead (2 features vs 12)
3. **Deterministic Interventions**: All intervention flags can be set for future dates
4. **Recovery Index**: Provides smooth continuous measure vs. discrete flags
5. **Optional Rolling Stats**: Included but can be excluded to reduce feature count
6. **Model-Specific Datasets**: Optimized variants for each model type

## 🎯 Alignment with Guidelines

From `.github/agents/tourism-forecasting.md`:
- ✅ Temporal features (day, month, year) - DONE
- ✅ Seasonality indicators - DONE (cyclical encoding)
- ✅ Lag features - DONE (1, 3, 6, 12)
- ✅ Rolling window statistics - DONE (3, 12)
- ✅ Event-based features (shocks) - DONE (3 interventions)
- ✅ Handle missing values - DONE (forward fill)
- ✅ Feature scaling - DOCUMENTED (use MinMaxScaler for NN)

From problem statement:
- ✅ Small dataset constraint acknowledged - Minimal features
- ✅ Consistency maintained - All features known at forecast time
- ✅ Avoid leakage - Rolling stats computed on past only
- ✅ Parity layer - Shared core + model-specific
- ✅ Reusability - Modular functions for production

## 🚀 Next Steps

The feature engineering is complete and ready for model development:

1. **Prophet** (Issue 4): Use `features_prophet.csv` with interventions as regressors
2. **LSTM** (Issue 5): Use `features_ml_clean.csv` with MinMaxScaler
3. **Chronos** (Issue 6): Use original CSV (univariate)
4. **N-HiTS** (Issue 7): Use `features_ml_clean.csv` or univariate

All datasets are prepared and validated. Models can now be trained using the appropriate feature sets.
