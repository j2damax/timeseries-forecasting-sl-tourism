# Implementation Summary: End-to-End Training & Evaluation Pipeline

## Overview

This PR implements a complete end-to-end training and evaluation pipeline for the Sri Lanka Tourism Forecasting project, as specified in the problem statement.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ 1. Minimal Feature Generation (Section 1)

**Script:** `scripts/generate_minimal_features.py`

Creates three minimal feature files from existing feature engineering outputs:
- `minimal_features_prophet.csv` (91×5): ds, y, intervention flags
- `minimal_features_lstm.csv` (79×9): Date, Arrivals, interventions, cyclical encodings, key lags
- `chronos_series.csv` (91×2): Date, Arrivals (univariate)

**Verification:**
```bash
$ python scripts/generate_minimal_features.py
✓ All files generated successfully
```

### ✅ 2. Chronological Data Splitting (Section 2)

**Script:** `scripts/data_splits.py`

Implements fixed date boundary splits with validation:
- **Train:** 2017-01-01 to 2022-12-01 (72 samples)
- **Validation:** 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-01 (12 samples)
- **Test:** 2024-01-01 to 2024-07-01 (7 samples)

**Key Features:**
- Boolean mask-based splitting
- Chronological validation (no future leakage)
- Split info saved to `data/processed/splits.json`

**Verification:**
```bash
$ python scripts/data_splits.py
✓ Chronological split validation passed: No future leakage detected
```

### ✅ 3. Evaluation Framework (Section 3)

**Integration:** Uses existing `scripts/evaluation.py` with enhancements

**Metrics Implemented:**
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) - primary ranking metric
- R² (Coefficient of Determination)

**Additional Features:**
- Visualization functions (`plot_predictions`)
- Consistent metric calculation across all models

### ✅ 4. Prophet Pipeline (Section 4)

**Script:** `scripts/train_prophet.py`

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Minimal features loading (ds, y, regressors)
- ✅ Model configuration (yearly_seasonality='auto', linear growth)
- ✅ External regressors (easter_attacks, covid_period, economic_crisis)
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning via grid search
  - changepoint_prior_scale: [0.05, 0.1, 0.2]
  - seasonality_prior_scale: [5, 10]
- ✅ Rolling-origin validation (12 steps for Jan-Dec 2023)
- ✅ Final model training on train+validation
- ✅ Test forecast generation with regressors

**Outputs:**
