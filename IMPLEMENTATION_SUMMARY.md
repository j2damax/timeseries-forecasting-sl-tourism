# Implementation Summary - Minimal Feature Engineering

## Overview

Successfully implemented a **streamlined, minimal feature engineering pipeline** focused exclusively on Prophet, LSTM, and Chronos models, as specified in the problem statement.

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated Intervention Features ✓

Replaced old intervention definitions with new simplified ones:

**Old Features** → **New Features**:
- `easter_attacks` (1 month) → `easter_impact` (6 months: Apr 2019 - Sep 2019)
- `covid_period` (22 months) → `covid` (22 months: Mar 2020 - Dec 2021) 
- `economic_crisis` (31 months) → `econ_crisis` (6 months: Apr 2022 - Sep 2022)
- `recovery_index` (continuous) → `recovery` (binary: Nov 2022 onwards)
- `months_since_covid` → **REMOVED**

### 2. Reduced Lag Features ✓

**Old**: `Arrivals_lag_1`, `Arrivals_lag_3`, `Arrivals_lag_6`, `Arrivals_lag_12` (4 lags)  
**New**: `Arrivals_lag_1`, `Arrivals_lag_12` (2 lags only)

Rationale: Keep only short-term persistence (lag_1) and annual seasonality proxy (lag_12).

### 3. Removed Rolling Statistics ✓

**Removed**:
- `Arrivals_rolling_mean_3`
- `Arrivals_rolling_mean_12`
- `Arrivals_rolling_std_3`
- `Arrivals_rolling_std_12`

Rationale: Too few observations (91 months), high overfitting risk.

### 4. Updated Code Files ✓

**Modified Files**:
- `scripts/preprocessing.py` - Updated `create_intervention_features()` and deprecated `create_recovery_index()`
- `scripts/feature_engineering.py` - Complete rewrite with minimal functions:
  - `create_minimal_features()` - Base minimal feature set
  - `create_prophet_data()` - Prophet-formatted data
  - `create_lstm_data()` - LSTM-ready features
  - `split_train_val_test()` - Chronological data splits
  - `create_lstm_sequences()` - 24-month sliding windows
  - `get_feature_columns()` - Feature column lists

**New Files**:
- `scripts/generate_minimal_features.py` - Automated feature generation script
- `test_minimal_features.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `MINIMAL_FEATURE_ENGINEERING.md` - Detailed documentation
- `QUICKSTART_MINIMAL.md` - Quick start guide

### 5. Generated Model-Specific Datasets ✓

**For Prophet**:
- `prophet_regressors.csv` (91 rows × 6 columns)
  - Columns: ds, y, easter_impact, covid, econ_crisis, recovery
  - No missing values
  - Full date range preserved (2017-01 to 2024-07)

**For LSTM**:
- `lstm_train.npz` - Training sequences (36, 24, 9)
- `lstm_val.npz` - Validation sequences (12, 24, 9)
- `lstm_test.npz` - Test sequences (7, 24, 9)
- `scaler.pkl` - MinMaxScaler fitted on training data
- Window size: 24 months
- Features: 9 (Arrivals + 2 lags + 2 cyclical + 4 interventions)

**For Chronos**:
- `chronos_context.npy` - Context series (84 values: 2017-01 to 2023-12)
- `chronos_test.npy` - Test targets (7 values: 2024-01 to 2024-07)

**Base Features**:
- `engineered_features.csv` (79 rows × 10 columns)
  - All minimal features in one file
  - Starts from 2018-01 (after lag_12 removal)

### 6. Implemented Fixed Data Splits ✓

**Chronological Split**:
```
Train:      2018-01 to 2022-12  (60 months)
Validation: 2023-01 to 2023-12  (12 months)
Test:       2024-01 to 2024-07  (7 months)
```

**Implementation**: `split_train_val_test()` function with default boundaries.

### 7. Created LSTM Sequences ✓

**Configuration**:
- Input window: 24 months (2 full annual cycles)
- Forecast horizon: 1 month ahead
- Scaled features: Arrivals, lags, cyclical month
- Binary features: Kept as 0/1

**Smart Splitting**: Sequences created from combined dataset but assigned to train/val/test based on target date to ensure adequate context for all predictions.

### 8. Comprehensive Testing ✓

Created `test_minimal_features.py` with 8 test cases:
1. ✓ Data loading
2. ✓ Minimal features structure
3. ✓ New intervention periods
4. ✓ Prophet data format
5. ✓ LSTM data creation
6. ✓ Data splits
7. ✓ Output files existence
8. ✓ LSTM sequences shape

**All tests pass successfully.**

### 9. Documentation ✓

python scripts/generate_minimal_features.py
```

### Run Tests

python test_minimal_features.py
```

### Use in Models

See `QUICKSTART_MINIMAL.md` for model-specific examples.

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Simplicity** - Reduced from 20+ features to just 10 essential features  
✅ **Focus** - Optimized specifically for Prophet, LSTM, Chronos  
✅ **Robustness** - Lower overfitting risk with minimal features  
✅ **Clarity** - Clear intervention periods aligned with problem statement  
✅ **Efficiency** - Removed all optional/nice-to-have features  
✅ **Consistency** - Fixed data splits for reproducible results  
✅ **Production-Ready** - Clean API, comprehensive tests, full documentation  

## Backward Compatibility

**Breaking Changes**:
- Old feature files (`monthly_tourist_arrivals_features_*.csv`) are deprecated
- Use new files: `engineered_features.csv`, `prophet_regressors.csv`, etc.
- Intervention flag names changed (e.g., `easter_attacks` → `easter_impact`)
- Recovery is now binary flag instead of continuous index

**Migration Path**:
Old code using `create_all_features()` or `create_ml_features()` should be updated to use:
- `create_minimal_features()` for base features
- `create_prophet_data()` for Prophet
- `create_lstm_data()` for LSTM

## Verification

All requirements from the problem statement have been implemented:

- [x] Only lag_1 and lag_12 (not 1,3,6,12)
- [x] Binary intervention flags with correct periods
- [x] No recovery_index (replaced with recovery flag)
- [x] No rolling statistics
- [x] Cyclical month encoding for LSTM
- [x] Data splits: Train (2018-01 to 2022-12), Val (2023), Test (2024-01 to 2024-07)
- [x] Prophet regressors file
- [x] LSTM sequences (24-month window)
- [x] Chronos arrays
- [x] Scaler artifact
- [x] Complete documentation

## Next Steps for Model Development

The feature engineering is **complete and ready for model training**. Next steps:

1. **Prophet Model** - Use `prophet_regressors.csv` with the 4 intervention regressors
2. **LSTM Model** - Load LSTM sequences and train with the provided 24×9 windows
3. **Chronos Model** - Use context array for zero-shot forecasting
4. **Model Comparison** - Evaluate all three models on the test set using consistent metrics
