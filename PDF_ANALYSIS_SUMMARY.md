# PDF Analysis Summary

## Task Completed ✅

Successfully analyzed 4 PDF files from `data/raw/` directory and created a review CSV file.

## Files Analyzed

| File | Month | Year | Arrivals | Status |
|------|-------|------|----------|---------|
| 01-2025.pdf | January | 2025 | 252,761 | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 02-2025.pdf | February | 2025 | 240,217 | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 03-2025.pdf | March | 2025 | 229,298 | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 04-2025.pdf | April | 2025 | 174,608 | ✅ SUCCESS |

**Extraction Success Rate: 100% (4/4 PDFs)**

## Output Files Created

### 1. `data/processed/monthly_tourist_arrivals_review.csv`
Primary output file for review. Contains the extracted tourism data in the required format.

```csv
Date,Arrivals
2025-01-01,252761
2025-02-01,240217
2025-03-01,229298
2025-04-01,174608
```

### 2. `data/processed/extraction_details.csv`
Detailed metadata about each extraction, including:
- Extraction status (SUCCESS/FAILED/WARNING)
- Month and year identified
- Extraction method used
- Original formatted value

### 3. `scripts/analyze_pdfs.py`
Python script that performs the PDF analysis. Features:
- 7 different extraction patterns for robustness
- Handles various PDF formats and layouts
- Validates extracted values (range: 10k-500k)
- Generates both review CSV and detailed extraction log

### 4. `PDF_ANALYSIS_README.md`
Comprehensive documentation explaining:
- PDF structure and formats
- Extraction strategy and patterns
- Data validation approach
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide

## Data Format

The output CSV matches the required format as specified in repository documentation:

**Required Columns:**
- `Date`: First day of month in YYYY-MM-DD format (datetime)
- `Arrivals`: Total international tourist arrivals (integer)

This format is compatible with:
- `scripts/ingest_tourism_data.py` (existing pipeline)
- Jupyter notebooks (01_Data_Ingestion_and_EDA.ipynb, etc.)
- `scripts/data_loader.py` functions

## Extraction Methods Used

Different patterns were required for different PDF formats:

| PDF | Pattern Used | Description |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| 01-2025.pdf | influx pattern | "influx of 252,761 tourists in January" |
| 02-2025.pdf | percentage increase pattern | "240,217, a 10.01% increase" |
| 03-2025.pdf | Month with/recorded pattern | "March with 229,298" |
| 04-2025.pdf | Month YYYY arrivals reached | "April 2025 arrivals reached 174,608" |

## Data Verification

All extracted values have been:
- ✅ Validated against reasonable range (10,000 - 500,000 per month)
- ✅ Formatted correctly (removed commas, converted to integers)
- ✅ Checked for month/year consistency
- ✅ Sorted chronologically

## Next Steps

### For Review:
1. **Verify the data** in `monthly_tourist_arrivals_review.csv`
2. **Check extraction details** in `extraction_details.csv`
3. **Cross-reference** with original PDF files if needed

### To Add More Data:
1. **Upload additional PDF files** to `data/raw/` directory
   - Download from: https://www.sltda.gov.lk/en/monthly-tourist-arrivals-reports
   - Name consistently (e.g., `05-2025.pdf`, `01-2024.pdf`, etc.)

2. **Re-run the analysis:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_pdfs.py
   ```

3. **Review updated CSVs** and proceed with time series forecasting

## Integration with Existing Workflow

The analysis script complements the existing data ingestion pipeline:

```
Manual Workflow (Current):
├── Upload PDFs to data/raw/
├── Run: python scripts/analyze_pdfs.py
├── Review: data/processed/monthly_tourist_arrivals_review.csv
└── Use in forecasting models

Automated Workflow (Existing):
├── Run: python scripts/ingest_tourism_data.py
├── Scrapes SLTDA website (if accessible)
├── Downloads PDFs automatically
├── Extracts and saves to data/processed/monthly_tourist_arrivals.csv
└── Use in forecasting models
```

## Technical Summary

### Script Capabilities:
- ✅ Multi-pattern extraction (7 strategies)
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ Data validation
- ✅ Detailed logging
- ✅ Review-friendly output

### Dependencies:
- `pdfplumber` - PDF text extraction
- `pandas` - Data manipulation
- `re` - Pattern matching

### Performance:
- Processing time: ~1 second per PDF
- Memory efficient (streaming text extraction)
- Handles PDFs with newlines and formatting variations

## Conclusion

All 4 PDF files have been successfully analyzed and the review CSV has been created. The data is ready for verification and can be used immediately in the forecasting pipeline once approved.
