## üìä Project Overview

The Sri Lanka Tourism Forecasting project aims to:
- Forecast monthly tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka
- Compare multiple forecasting approaches
- Answer: Can deep learning outperform statistical methods?

### Models to Implement
1. **Prophet** - Statistical/ML approach with event handling
2. **LSTM** - Deep learning for complex patterns
3. **Chronos** - Pre-trained foundation model (zero-shot)
4. **N-HiTS** - State-of-the-art hierarchical neural architecture

### Project Phases
1. **Data Foundation** (Issues 1-3) - Ingest, explore, prepare data
2. **Model Development** (Issues 4-7) - Implement four models
3. **Evaluation** (Issue 8) - Compare and analyze
4. **Infrastructure** (Issues 9-10) - Build utilities
5. **Documentation** (Issue 11) - Ensure reproducibility
6. **Quality** (Issue 12) - Testing framework

## üîë Key Information

### Data Specifications
- **Source**: Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA)
- **Time Range**: January 2000 - December 2024
- **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Training**: 2000-2022
- **Testing**: 2023 (12-month forecast)

### Evaluation Metrics
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R¬≤ Score
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

### Critical Conventions
- ‚úÖ **Chronological splits** (never shuffle time series data)
- ‚úÖ **Forward fill** for missing values
- ‚úÖ **MinMaxScaler** for neural networks
- ‚úÖ **Raw values** for Prophet/statistical models
- ‚úÖ **Standard columns**: `Date` (datetime), `Arrivals` (int)

## üéì Understanding the Issues

### Issue Priorities Explained

**High Priority (Must Complete First)**
- Issues 1-3: Data pipeline is foundation for everything
- Issues 4-5, 7: Core models for comparison
- Issue 8: Final analysis and conclusions

**Medium Priority (Important but Dependent)**
- Issue 6: Chronos adds value but not critical path
- Issues 9-10: Utilities support but not block implementation
- Issue 11: Documentation important for reproducibility

**Low Priority (Quality Improvement)**
- Issue 12: Testing helps maintain quality but not required for initial implementation

### Dependencies Between Issues

## üí° Tips for Success

### For Implementation
1. **Follow the sequence**: Complete data issues before model issues
2. **Test early**: Run data ingestion first to verify pipeline
3. **Document as you go**: Update notebooks with findings
4. **Save artifacts**: Store trained models for comparison
5. **Use utilities**: Leverage `scripts/` modules for consistency

### For Issue Management
1. **Check off tasks**: Update checkboxes as you progress
2. **Add comments**: Document challenges and solutions
3. **Link commits**: Reference issue numbers in commit messages
4. **Close when done**: Verify acceptance criteria before closing
5. **Review regularly**: Keep track of overall progress

### For Code Quality
1. **Follow conventions**: See `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. **Reuse code**: Use `scripts/` utilities, don't duplicate
3. **Document choices**: Explain hyperparameters and decisions
4. **Visualize results**: Create clear, labeled plots
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify train/test splits have no leakage
