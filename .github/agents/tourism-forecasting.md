# Tourism Forecasting Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **forecasting international tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka** through a comparative analysis of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The work addresses a critical economic need while providing a rigorous test of various forecasting methodologies.

## Context and Motivation

### Problem Statement
The tourism sector is a cornerstone of the Sri Lankan economy, serving as:
- A critical source of foreign exchange
- A significant generator of employment
- A catalyst for regional development

Accurate forecasting of tourist arrivals is essential for:
- Government bodies formulating national economic policy
- Private enterprises making investment and resource allocation decisions
- Strategic planning and budgeting within the tourism industry

### Key Challenges
The Sri Lankan tourism time series presents unique analytical challenges:

1. **Strong Seasonality**: Dictated by climate and cultural festivals
2. **Profound Volatility**: High sensitivity to domestic and international shocks
3. **Structural Breaks**: Multiple regime changes over the past two decades:
   - End of civil conflict (pre-2009)
   - Post-war tourism boom (mid-2009 onwards)
   - Easter Sunday terrorist attacks (2019)
   - COVID-19 pandemic collapse (2020-2021)
   - Economic crisis and volatile recovery (2022-)

These characteristics make historical patterns potentially unreliable guides for future trends.

## Research Context

### Literature Findings

The literature review establishes that:

1. **SARIMA is the benchmark**: Multiple independent studies confirm its excellence for Sri Lankan tourism forecasting
2. **Machine learning shows promise**: MLR and XGBR demonstrated high accuracy in recent studies
3. **Deep learning gap**: Limited application of LSTM to Sri Lankan context; no documented use of TFT or N-HiTS

### Central Research Question

**Can advanced deep learning architectures, designed to capture complex non-linear patterns, outperform the established statistical champion (SARIMA) on a time series characterized by strong, regular seasonality but punctuated by extreme, irregular shocks?**

## Critical Considerations

### Model Strengths vs. Data Characteristics

The unique challenge of this dataset is the tension between:
- **Regular patterns**: Strong annual seasonality (favors SARIMA, Holt-Winters)
- **Irregular shocks**: Extreme volatility and structural breaks (favors flexible ML/DL models)

The most successful model will likely be one that:
- Captures regular seasonal patterns efficiently
- Adapts quickly to structural changes
- Provides robust forecasts during volatile periods

### Data Limitations

**Current limitation**: Univariate time series only

**Potential enhancements** for future work:
- Currency exchange rates
- Domestic inflation indicators
- International flight prices
- Google search query volumes for Sri Lankan travel
- Other exogenous economic indicators

### Ethical Considerations

- Forecasts should be rigorous and data-driven
- Avoid politically motivated optimism
- Recognize impact on policy and investment decisions
- Maintain transparency in methodology and limitations

## Future Extensions

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **SARIMAX Implementation**:
   - Direct comparison with literature benchmarks
   - Formal statistical testing of engineered event variables
   - Validation of feature significance

2. **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**:
   - Multi-horizon, multivariate forecasting capability
   - Can incorporate static covariates, known future inputs, and observed past inputs
   - Built-in interpretability mechanisms (variable selection, attention weights)
   - Would enable integration of exogenous variables

3. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Combine predictions from best-performing models
   - Weighted averaging (e.g., N-HiTS + Prophet)
   - Often more robust than individual models
