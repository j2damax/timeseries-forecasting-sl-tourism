# Before & After Comparison

## Feature Engineering Transformation

This document shows the transformation from the original feature engineering to the minimal approach.

## Before: Original Approach

### Feature Set
**Total Features**: 20 columns

**Columns**:
```
Date, Arrivals, year, month, quarter, month_sin, month_cos,
easter_attacks, covid_period, economic_crisis, months_since_covid, recovery_index,
Arrivals_lag_1, Arrivals_lag_3, Arrivals_lag_6, Arrivals_lag_12,
Arrivals_rolling_mean_3, Arrivals_rolling_std_3,
Arrivals_rolling_mean_12, Arrivals_rolling_std_12
```

### Datasets
- `monthly_tourist_arrivals_features_full.csv` (91×20)
- `monthly_tourist_arrivals_features_prophet.csv` (91×9)
- `monthly_tourist_arrivals_features_ml.csv` (91×15)
- `monthly_tourist_arrivals_features_ml_clean.csv` (79×15)

### Issues
❌ Too many features for small dataset (91 observations)  
❌ Rolling statistics prone to overfitting  
❌ Redundant lag features (lag_3, lag_6)  
❌ Complex recovery_index calculation  
❌ Multiple overlapping dataset files  

## After: Minimal Approach

### Feature Set
**Total Features**: 10 columns

**Columns**:
```
Date, Arrivals,
easter_impact, covid, econ_crisis, recovery,
month_sin, month_cos,
Arrivals_lag_1, Arrivals_lag_12
```

### Datasets
**Base Features**:
- `engineered_features.csv` (79×10) - All features in one file

**Model-Specific**:
- `prophet_regressors.csv` (91×6) - Prophet format
- `lstm_train.npz` (36, 24, 9) - LSTM training sequences
- `lstm_val.npz` (12, 24, 9) - LSTM validation sequences
- `lstm_test.npz` (7, 24, 9) - LSTM test sequences
- `chronos_context.npy` (84,) - Chronos context
- `chronos_test.npy` (7,) - Chronos test targets
- `scaler.pkl` - MinMaxScaler artifact

### Improvements
✅ 50% feature reduction (20 → 10)  
✅ No rolling statistics (removed 4 features)  
✅ Only essential lags (removed lag_3, lag_6)  
✅ Binary intervention flags (simpler, deterministic)  
✅ Model-specific optimized datasets  
✅ Ready-to-use sequences and scalers  

## Detailed Comparison

### Intervention Features

| Feature | Before | After | Change |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Easter attacks | `easter_attacks` (1 month) | `easter_impact` (6 months) | Extended period |
| COVID period | `covid_period` (22 months) | `covid` (22 months) | Renamed |
| Economic crisis | `economic_crisis` (31 months) | `econ_crisis` (6 months) | Focused period |
| Recovery | `recovery_index` (continuous 0-1) + `months_since_covid` | `recovery` (binary) | Simplified |

### Lag Features

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `Arrivals_lag_1` | `Arrivals_lag_1` ✓ |
| `Arrivals_lag_3` | ❌ Removed |
| `Arrivals_lag_6` | ❌ Removed |
| `Arrivals_lag_12` | `Arrivals_lag_12` ✓ |

**Rationale**: Keep only short-term persistence (lag_1) and annual seasonality (lag_12).

### Rolling Statistics

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `Arrivals_rolling_mean_3` | ❌ Removed |
| `Arrivals_rolling_std_3` | ❌ Removed |
| `Arrivals_rolling_mean_12` | ❌ Removed |
| `Arrivals_rolling_std_12` | ❌ Removed |

**Rationale**: Too few observations (91 months) makes rolling statistics unreliable and prone to overfitting.

### Temporal Features

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `year` | ❌ Removed (Prophet handles internally) |
| `month` | ❌ Removed (Prophet handles internally) |
| `quarter` | ❌ Removed (Prophet handles internally) |
| `month_sin` | `month_sin` ✓ (for LSTM) |
| `month_cos` | `month_cos` ✓ (for LSTM) |

**Rationale**: Prophet has built-in seasonality modeling. LSTM uses cyclical encoding for month.

```

**Note**: After approach includes pre-computed sequences and artifacts, making it larger but more convenient for immediate model training.

## API Comparison

### Before
```python
from feature_engineering import create_all_features, create_prophet_features, create_ml_features

df_all = create_all_features(df)  # 20 columns
df_prophet = create_prophet_features(df)  # 12 columns
df_ml = create_ml_features(df, include_lags=True, include_rolling=True)  # 16 columns
```

### After
```python
from feature_engineering import create_minimal_features, create_prophet_data, create_lstm_data

df_minimal = create_minimal_features(df)  # 10 columns
df_prophet = create_prophet_data(df)  # 6 columns (ds, y, regressors)
df_lstm = create_lstm_data(df, drop_na=True)  # 10 columns
```

**Simplification**: Clearer function names, fewer parameters, more focused output.

## Test Coverage

### Before
- `test_feature_engineering.py` - Tests old approach
- 8 test cases
- All features validated

### After
- `test_minimal_features.py` - Tests new minimal approach
- 8 test cases focused on:
  - Minimal feature structure
  - New intervention periods
  - Prophet format
  - LSTM sequences
  - Data splits
  - Output files

**Both test suites pass ✓**

## Migration Path

If you have existing code using the old approach:

**Step 1**: Replace import
```python
# Before
from feature_engineering import create_ml_features

# After
from feature_engineering import create_lstm_data
```

**Step 2**: Update function call
```python
# Before
df = create_ml_features(df, include_lags=True, include_rolling=False, drop_na=True)

# After
df = create_lstm_data(df, drop_na=True)
```

**Step 3**: Update column references
```python
# Before
regressors = ['easter_attacks', 'covid_period', 'economic_crisis', 'recovery_index']

# After
regressors = ['easter_impact', 'covid', 'econ_crisis', 'recovery']
```

## Results
